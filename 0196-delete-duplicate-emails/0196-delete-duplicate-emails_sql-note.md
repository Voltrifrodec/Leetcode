Doing penetrance between Person (person1) and its clone (person2) using join by email and keeping first that matches the equation (?)

If I'd use person1.id < person2.id, I'd get the exact opposite -- the greater ID would remain, and smaller excluded (same thing would be achieved by deleting person2 instead of person1)
